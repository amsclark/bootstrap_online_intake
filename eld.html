<p>Legal Aid of Nebraska will use the information you provide to see if you qualify for our services. However, completing an application does NOT mean that Legal Aid of Nebraska will accept your case. Legal Aid of Nebraska cannot assist everyone who applies for help. Completing an application does NOT create an attorney-client relationship. And, it does NOT mean you are a client of Legal Aid of Nebraska.</p>
<p><strong>Legal Aid of Nebraska cannot help with the following</strong></p>
<ul class="list-unstyled">
<li>&#8226; Traffic tickets</li>
<li>&#8226; Criminal cases (unless they are filed in tribal court)</li>

<p>It is ok to have someone help you complete this application. The application should be completed using your personal information. We have to talk to you unless you have someone who is authorized to speak on your behalf.</p>

<p>If you are Power of Attorney for the applicant, we can talk to you directly if you provide the Power of Attorney Document. Please complete the application in the applicant's name, indicate on the application that you are the power of attorney and send us the Power of Attorney document by email at accesslineattorneys@legalaidofnebraska.com, or by fax to (402) 348-1065, Attention: ElderAccessLine®, or by mail at ElderAccessLine® 1904 Farnam St., Suite 500, Omaha, NE 68102.</p>
