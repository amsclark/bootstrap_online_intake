  <p>Legal Aid of Nebraska will use the information you provide to see if you qualify for our services. However, completing an application does NOT mean that Legal Aid of Nebraska will accept your case. Legal Aid of Nebraska cannot assist everyone who applies for help. Completing an application does NOT create an attorney-client relationship. And, it does NOT mean you are a client of Legal Aid of Nebraska.</p>
  <p><strong>Legal Aid of Nebraska cannot help with the following</strong></p>
  <ul class="list-unstyled">
    <li>&#8226; Traffic tickets</li>

  <p>It is ok to have someone help you complete this application. The application should be completed using your personal information. But, we cannot talk to someone else about your legal problem until we talk to you.</p>
