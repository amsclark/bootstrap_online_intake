<p>Legal Aid of Nebraska will use the information you provide to see if you qualify for our services. However, completing an application does NOT mean that Legal Aid of Nebraska will accept your case. Legal Aid of Nebraska cannot assist everyone who applies for help. Completing an application does NOT create an attorney-client relationship. And, it does NOT mean you are a client of Legal Aid of Nebraska.</p>
<strong>Legal Aid of Nebraska cannot help with the following:</strong>
<br>
<ul class="list-unstyled">
<li>&#8226; Traffic tickets</li>
<li>&#8226; Criminal cases (unless they are filed in tribal court)</li>
<li>&#8226; Worker's compensation cases</li>
<li>&#8226; Personal injury cases</li>

<p>It is ok to have someone help you complete this application. The application should be completed using your personal information. But, we cannot talk to someone else about your legal problem until we talk to you.</p>
<br>
<p>You should expect to receive an email response about your application from Legal Aid of Nebraska within 5 business days. If it looks like you qualify for services from Legal Aid, we will schedule a call for you to talk to an intake paralegal. We will schedule the call based upon the best times you provide us in the application. We will tell you what day and time we will call you in our email response to you. If you do not hear back from us, it is your responsibility to contact us at the number above.
